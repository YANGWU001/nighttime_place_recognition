When running these codes, please make sure your current directory is this folder. sample(500, 1000, 2000).py are codes for generate threshold files(500, 1000, 2000).  For thresholds in each result(500,1000,2000).txt file, we calculate their mean,median, 25% quantile, and minimum value. These values will be used as threshold in testing.py to generate a csv file which contains the results for each threshoud.
